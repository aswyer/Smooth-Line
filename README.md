# Smooth-Line
 
This is a weird & incomplete drawing program that smooths hand drawn input. Before doing any research, I created this for fun to see how this could be accomplished. While it does successfully smooth the input, something like the [Ramer Douglas Peucker algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer–Douglas–Peucker_algorithm) would be the correct way to accomplish this.
